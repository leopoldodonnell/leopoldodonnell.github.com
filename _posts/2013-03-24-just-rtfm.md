I still remember the first time I heard someone say **RTFM**. It was in the mini-computer lab back in college during 1984 
while I was working on the standard *write your own shell in "C"*  assignment for the *new* operating system, **UNIX**. There weren't
a lot of experts around so I was told I could learn everything I needed if I RTFM - HA! Its twenty-nine years later and I'm still trying 
to decipher the Freaking Manual.

Programming is a real craft and while my programming life has been consumed, to some degree, by righting the wrongs of the poorly 
or hastily developed code of others; it pales, in comparison, to the time spent trying to figure out how to use the libraries and 
frameworks needed to get something done.

I can't count the number of *Ah-ha!* moments I've had once I've figured out what they really meant in the
documentation, or finally finding the correct functions/methods to call after grep'ing an googling all over the
place. I've got to say I'm truly thankful for Internet search, sites like [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com),
[Github](http://github.com) and folks how actually go to the trouble to use the documentation tools available to help others
use the great stuff they've built.

This blog is my attempt to make things easier for others, my team, and myself (I tend to forget things after I put them down for
a few weeks) who need to do all manner of developer related activity. I tend to do a bit of everything; I lead technology as a CTO,
design, code, deal with sys-ops etc; so there'll be a real variety of subjects covered.

**ENJOY!**
